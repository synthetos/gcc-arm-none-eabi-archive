# gcc-arm-none-eabi-archive

This serves to archive the ARM GCC for bare-metal Cortex-M and Cortext-R, or as ARM calls it the [GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm), built by them (when available) or us.

When we build it we use their source package and build instructions, changing as little as possible, to get the binaries for the build target only (IOW, we don't cross-compile for Windows from Raspberry Pi for the `armv7l` target).
